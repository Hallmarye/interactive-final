					<p class="lead">Meet Kelly, 45, who lives with her husband, Malcolm, at approximately State and Lake. She's also homeless, opiod-addicted and six months pregnant.
					</p>
					<p>“When it’s cold, we usually go to the trains. But I still hate the train because you’re constantly moving and you can’t really sleep. It’s difficult and we don’t make, you know, a lot of money.”</p>

					<p id="all-centers">During the day, there are 117 warming centers open in Chicago. They are used by people who are chronically homelessness, defined as having slept somewhere "not designed for human habitation" for over a year, or more than three times over three years. These centers are also used by people who may not be able to afford to heat their home 24/7 or those who are temporarily homeless.
					</p>
					<p id="senior-centers">Six warming centers only serve senior citizens.</p>
					<p id="police-stations">23 are police stations, which Kelly says she would never go into, because of her addiction.</p>
					<p id="libraries">The remaining 88 are libraries, hospitals and community centers. However, most close by 8 p.m., putting Kelly and her husband back on the street.</p>
					<p id="walkable">The only one open 24 hours a day is located in Garfield Park, about 4 miles away.</p>

                  A couple sleeps in the former Lower Wacker homeless encampment. With this winter being predicted as more frigid than average, the cold is increasingly on the minds of those who are homeless.
              </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p id="all-shelters">There are nine emergency shelters in Chicago, which provide a place to sleep for one night. Here there are often opportunities to find more permanent housing solutions, but many are only available to those who can prove they are drug-free or have long waiting lists. Chronically-homeless, Kelly and Malcom say they only choose to go to a shelter if they have made enough money “busking,” what they call asking for money on the street. People have to arrive at the shelter by 7 p.m. in order to get a bed. Since Kelly and Malcolm make most of their money between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., usually they can’t make it to a shelter in time. If they do decide to try for a shelter, their options are limited.
          </p>
          <p id="youth-shelters">Six of the nine shelters only serve youth or families.</p>
          <p id="mens-shelters">One only serves men.</p>
          <p id="coed-shelters">Two serves both men and women, but if there are more people than available beds, the people who get beds are chosen by lottery. “I will only stay if [Malcom] gets a bed too,” Kelly said. </p>

					<p>If Kelly and Malcolm don’t get a spot in a shelter, there are two other options, Kelly says. Northwestern Memorial Hospital offers a warming center, where people can sit up overnight. Chairs are limited through, and they have to be in line by 9 p.m. or they wont get a seat, she added. </p>
					<p>The city has opened an overnight warming center, what Kelly describes as an open gym-like room where about 50 can find a spot to lay down. However, the odor and atmostphere is extremely unpleasant, Kelly said. “The shelters and warming centers are dirty and dangerous. We’d rather take the train.”</p>
